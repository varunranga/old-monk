Humans encounter dreadful diseases during the course of their life. One of those worse-than-death tortures faced by a few is
The Alzheimer's disease. To cater to needs of patients suffering from memory loss, we intend to build a device that will stay by your side to listen, help, aid and remind you of all the important activities that one needs to pursue in their life. The device will not only work as a memory for these patients, but will help in tracking their vitals such as blood pressure and heart rate, without having the need to go to a specialized doctor for these trivial tasks.

How?
1) Microphone picks up conversations, and converts this speech to a suitable form to store onto memory. This is done using
speech-to-text APIs.
2) This text-based converted input will be stored onto a log file, so that the patients and their care-taker can keep track.
3) It will parse through the text stored in the log through NLP (Natural Language Processing) toolkits, and will be able to
set reminders for the patient or the care-taker to follow. 
4) A personal assistance program which can reply to the patient, if ever the patient feels the need to share or help them remember important information that can be fetched from the database.

Finally, what is it?
A Device to help the ones who helped us the most.
